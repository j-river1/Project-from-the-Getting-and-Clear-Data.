# Project the Getting and Clear Data.
This a final project from getting and clear data course. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The data is based on accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. For more information visit the following link http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

This project is composed by three files; run_analysys, README and CodeBook. The run_analysis is a code in r that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The CodeBook file shows all variables, measures and their descriptions from project.
